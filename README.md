## The Situation

We are a biotechnology firm looking to hire new employees with the right set of skills we require. In our case, we are looking to hire an individual who has proof of skills and relevant experience within an intersection between Data Science and Bio Technology.

## The Role & Hiring Requirements

We require someone who has expertise in using software to analyze trends in biological raw lab data. Specifically, we have a large artificial farm of mutated-gene crops that we are growing. We tweak the genetic composition of the specimens and analyze results on their growth, yield, and the nutritional factors of their yield, and this is what we would expect from the best candidate.

## No Training Required

Because we are planning to use the freely available APIs of OpenAIâ€™s pre-trained models (given our own custom prompts), we do not need the *data_creation.py* file

## Files

- `requirements.md`
- `main.py`
- `resume_parser.py`
- `keyword_generator.py`
- `relevance_checker.py`

### Progress Update

It is worth noting that since beginning this project, due to a large number of bottlenecks faced with openaiâ€™s GPT libraries (specifically them outputting completely unrelated keywords ðŸ˜…), we have shifted to a much simpler relevance score checker now. Note: you can see the details of what problems were faced by looking at commmits on and around commit 2758866.

Possible AI integration in the future once I have time to focus on this project.
